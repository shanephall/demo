## Going Solar

Interested in going solar but you rent your home, or can’t afford to invest in panels? Maybe you're like Michael Reunert, past president of the Hillsdale Community Foundation. When he had a solar company come and take a look at his roof, he was told, “You would have to cut your trees, and your neighbor's trees, to get enough sun on your roof.”

But you can switch to solar and save money without a sunny roof. How? By subscribing to solar electricity generated at a project elsewhere in PGE’s service area and getting credit against your bill. Watch a YouTube video from Oregon Shines explaining how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fDbe3F7-I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6fDbe3F7-I).

Subscribe through the Hillsdale Community Foundation here, and both you and the Foundation will receive a $25 e-gift card. Help yourself, your community, and the environment all at once!
