## SECTION 5: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

**5.01 Conflict of Interest Transactions**

When a situation occurs where a board member has a conflict of interest, the board member must declare and/or recuse themself from any vote taken on this matter. A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director or officer of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director or officer if:

(a) the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into,

(b) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s or officer’s interests are disclosed or known to the Board of Directors,

(c) the Board of Directors considers and in good faith determines after reasonable investigation in the circumstances that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort in the circumstances,

(d) the corporation enters into the transaction for its own benefit, and

(e) the transaction is approved either (i) by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors, or (ii) by obtaining the approval of the Oregon Attorney General or a circuit court of the State of Oregon in an action in which the Oregon Attorney General is joined as a party.

For the purposes of this section, a director or officer of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if:

(a) an entity other than the corporation in which the director or officer has a material interest or in which the director or officer is a general partner is a party to the transaction, or

(b) an entity other than the corporation of which the director or officer is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction.

For purposes of this section, a conflict-of-interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. A transaction may not be authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under this section if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in this section.

**5.02 Loans to or Guaranties for Directors and Officers**

The corporation may not lend money or guarantee the obligation of a director or officer of the corporation provided; however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of such director or officer if, in the absence of such advance, such director or officer would be entitled to be reimbursed for such expenses by the corporation.

## SECTION 6: ADMINISTRATION OF PERMANENT FUND

**6.01 Designation**

The Board of Directors shall administer a separate fund, known as the “Permanent Fund,” for the purpose of providing the corporation with the permanent source of financial support. The Permanent Fund shall be accounted for as a separate Board-restricted fund on the books and records of the corporation.

**6.02 Distributions**

An amount equal to or less than ten percent of the fair market value of the assets of the Permanent Fund on the last day of the preceding fiscal year of the corporation may be distributed each year to the general fund of the corporation. Additional distributions may be made only in an emergency or to fund a special opportunity, and then only upon the unanimous vote of at least two-thirds of the Board of Directors. The end of year asset valuation shall be posted on the Hillsdale Community Web Site, and all past years’ asset valuation shall also be posted as a permanent record on the web site. The record of annual Hillsdale Community Foundation distributions from all funds and expenses of the Foundation shall also be posted on the web site annually and maintained thereon.

**6.03 Valuation**

For purposes of determining the amount that may be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Section 6.02, the corporation may use any reasonable method to determine the fair market value of the securities for which market quotations are readily available and any commonly-accepted method of valuation for all other assets so long as such methods are used on a consistent basis. An independent appraisal shall not be required.

**6.04 Expenses**

Direct out-of-pocket expenses of administering the Permanent Fund may be paid from assets held in the Permanent Fund. All expenses must have the prior approval of the board, except that the treasurer can spend up to $200 between board meetings without prior approval. No indirect expenses or overhead allocations shall be charged against the Permanent Fund.

**6.05 Amendments**

The terms and conditions relating to the Permanent Fund may be amended from time to time by action of the Board of Directors, provided, however, that the provisions with respect to distributions set forth in Section 6.02 may be amended and the Permanent Fund may be terminated only upon the vote of at least two-thirds the entire Board of Directors.
